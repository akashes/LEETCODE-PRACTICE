// Given an integer arry num containing distinct positive integers . find and return any number from the arry that is neither the minimum nor the maximum value in the Array
// or -1 if there is not such number

let arr=[2,45,76]


function findNum(arr){

    arr.sort((a,b)=>a-b)

  if(arr.length<3){
    return -1
  }else{
    return arr[1]
  }



}

console.log(findNum(arr))

Nb: question specifies that array contains distinct numbers (ie no duplicated) . so just sort the array and select number which is not first or last elememnt. if number of elements is less than 3 then return -1
because the existing numbers would be either min or max which is not accepted...
